ðŸ“‘ BRD: Molecules (Modal, Tabs, Accordion)

â¸»

1. Objective

Develop Modal, Tabs, and Accordion as compound components that are:
	â€¢	Provider-driven but self-contained (no global provider clutter).
	â€¢	Scalable: reusable across SaaS apps, dashboards, and admin panels.
	â€¢	Accessible: ARIA-compliant + keyboard navigation.
	â€¢	Tokenized: styled with runtime CSS variables (var(--token)).
	â€¢	Documented: fully interactive in Storybook.
	â€¢	Tested: reliable with Vitest + React Testing Library.

2. Scope

In Scope
	â€¢	Modal system: Modal, ModalHeader, ModalBody, ModalFooter.
	â€¢	Tabs system: Tabs, Tabs.List, Tabs.Tab, Tabs.Panels, Tabs.Panel.
	â€¢	Accordion system: Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionHeader, AccordionBody.
	â€¢	Accessibility and ARIA roles for all.
	â€¢	Interactive Storybook stories with controls.
	â€¢	Unit and accessibility tests.

Out of Scope
	â€¢	Global modal manager (future).
	â€¢	Advanced features like draggable modals, nested tabs, multi-level accordions (Phase 2).

3. Business Requirements

ID	Requirement	Rationale
MOL-10	Modal must use compound subcomponents	Clean API (<Modal><ModalHeader/></Modal>)
MOL-11	Modal must handle focus, ESC, scroll lock	Production-grade UX
MOL-12	Tabs must support keyboard navigation	Inclusive design (Arrow, Home/End keys)
MOL-13	Tabs must expose compound API	Developer-friendly (Tabs.List, Tabs.Tab)
MOL-14	Accordion must support single & multiple expand	Common use cases
MOL-15	All Molecules must be styled via tokens	Consistent theming
MOL-16	All Molecules must be tested & documented	Reliability & adoption

4. Functional Requirements

4.1 Modal
	â€¢	Compound API:

<Modal>
  <Modal.Header>Title</Modal.Header>
  <Modal.Body>Content</Modal.Body>
  <Modal.Footer>Actions</Modal.Footer>
</Modal>


	â€¢	States: open, close.
	â€¢	Close methods: ESC, backdrop click, close button.
	â€¢	Prevent body scroll when open.
	â€¢	Focus trap + return focus to trigger.
	â€¢	Token-driven styling.

4.2 Tabs
	â€¢	Compound API:

<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Tab>Tab 1</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>Tab 2</Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panels>
    <Tabs.Panel>Content 1</Tabs.Panel>
    <Tabs.Panel>Content 2</Tabs.Panel>
  </Tabs.Panels>
</Tabs>


	â€¢	Controlled/uncontrolled state.
	â€¢	Keyboard support: ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Home, End.
	â€¢	ARIA roles: tablist, tab, tabpanel.

4.3 Accordion
	â€¢	Compound API:

<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Header>Section 1</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>Content 1</Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>


	â€¢	Modes: single (one open) / multiple (many open).
	â€¢	Keyboard support: ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Home, End.
	â€¢	ARIA roles: button, region.
	â€¢	Animations for expand/collapse.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
	â€¢	Performance: Local provider per instance (no global clutter).
	â€¢	Maintainability: Compound API â†’ easy to extend.
	â€¢	Scalability: Can add subcomponents (Modal.Close, Tabs.Indicator) without breaking API.
	â€¢	Accessibility: Full ARIA role + keyboard compliance.

â¸»

6. Dependencies
	â€¢	React 18 + Vite.
	â€¢	SCSS Modules.
	â€¢	Storybook (Vite builder).
	â€¢	Vitest + RTL.
	â€¢	No external UI libs (Modal, Tabs, Accordion built from core).

7. Deliverables
	â€¢	src/molecules/modal/* â†’ Modal + subcomponents.
	â€¢	src/molecules/tabs/* â†’ Tabs + subcomponents.
	â€¢	src/molecules/accordion/* â†’ Accordion + subcomponents.
	â€¢	SCSS modules with tokenized styling.
	â€¢	Storybook stories (interactive).
	â€¢	Vitest test suites.
	â€¢	Docs (docs/molecules-prd.md + this BRD).

8. Success Criteria
	â€¢	âœ… Modal opens/closes correctly, traps focus, restores trigger focus.
	â€¢	âœ… Tabs keyboard navigation works, ARIA roles correct.
	â€¢	âœ… Accordion expands/collapses smoothly, accessible via keyboard.
	â€¢	âœ… All styled via tokens, no hardcoded CSS.
	â€¢	âœ… Storybook shows all variants + interactions.
	â€¢	âœ… Test coverage â‰¥ 80%.

9. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
	â€¢	Modal stacking / global modal manager.
	â€¢	Lazy loading for Tabs.Panel.
	â€¢	Accordion nested rendering with animations.
	â€¢	Close-on-route-change for Modal.
	â€¢	RTL support across all Molecules.
